A Fastapi Backend that will communicate inbetween the CLI & the frontend.

Integration with FastAPI.
=========================

To test, first, start the server:

    $ docker-compose up

After the Docker build is complete you can view the Swagger documentation here:

    http://localhost:8000/docs

You can then create history in the Swagger UI with the following JSON object:

    {
        "command": "Assignment",
        "value": "1",
        "variable_name": "Test_Variable",
        "current_state": "Test_Variable"

}

    You can remove the pk fields from the JSON object (Unless you want to create one yourself) as it is generated by the server.

You can list all of the created history at the following URL:

    http://localhost:8000/history

You can find a specific commands at the following URL, you will have to get the pk of the commands you want to find from the list of commandss.

    http://localhost:8000/commands/{pk}

You can view the info about the redis database here:

    http://localhost:8001/

You might need to enter the following info:

    host: redis
    port: 6379
    
    
You are able to see the data in the Redis DB:
